> A rust implementation of the game [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) for the stm32f3 discovery board.

Using the stm32f3, an 8x8 LED display and an analog joystick, I implemented snake using Rust's real-time embedded framework for Cortex-M microcontrollers - Real Time For the Masses ([RTFM](https://github.com/rtfm-rs/cortex-m-rtfm)). This project was primarily a learning exercise in understanding how Rust can be used to solve some of the challenges inherent in embedded application development. It includes examples of how to:

- Initialise peripherals and interact with them (i.e. digital pins for the display, and ADCs for the joystick).
- Use RTFM to orchestrate software tasks that share mutable resources (i.e. peripherals).
- Write `macros!` to simplify repeated code patterns, in this case:
    * Logging messages through, and ensuring exclusive access to, Cortex's standard ITM peripheral.
    * Scheduling tasks based on the `sysclk` frequency and a desired delay (in seconds).

## Getting started
### Hardware setup
The hardware required for gameplay includes:
* [STM32F3DISCOVERY](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html)
* [MAX7219](https://core-electronics.com.au/max7219-serial-dot-matrix-display-module.html) LED display
* [Analog Joystick](https://www.jaycar.com.au/arduino-compatible-x-and-y-axis-joystick-module/p/XC4422)

Pin configuration is described in `main.rs` as part of the `init()` routine.

### Playing the game
To build and flash this game, I would suggest following the stm32f3-discovery tutorial [here](https://rust-embedded.github.io/discovery/03-setup/index.html) to prepare your development environment. Assuming one has the necessary tools installed, the contained `Makefile` can be used to build and flash the board.
```
$ make flash
```
Once the binary has been flashed the LED display will start to cycle through a binary pattern - this means the system is now ready for play. To start the game, click the joystick.
